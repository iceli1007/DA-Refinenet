Abstractâ€”Due to the high resolution of pathological images,
the automated semantic segmentation in the medical pathological
images has shown greater challenges than that in natural images.
Sliding Window method has shown its effect on solving problem
caused by the high resolution of whole slide images (WSI).
However, owing to its localization, Sliding Window method also
suffers from lack of global information. In this paper, a dual input
semantic segmentation network based on attention is proposed,
in which, one input provides small-scale fine information, the
other input provides large-scale coarse information. Compared
with single input methods, our method based on dual inputs
and attention: DA-RefineNet exhibits a dramatic performance
