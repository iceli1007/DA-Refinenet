Abstractâ€”Recent years, with the popularity of convolutional neural networks, medical image segmentation tasks based on deep learning have attracted more and more attention. Due to the high resolution of pathological images, the automated segmentation method for developing medical pathology images has greater challenges than natural images. At present, the semantic segmentation of whole slide image (WSI) adopts sliding window. This method, to some extent, has solved the high resolution of whole slide image and insufficient computer memory. However, owing to local feature extraction, it also causes lack of global information. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a dual input semantic segmentation network based on attention. One input provides small-scale fine information, and another provides large-scale coarse information. Compared with single input, our method CA-RefineNet has brought a great improvement in ICIAR2018 breast cancer segmentation dataset.
